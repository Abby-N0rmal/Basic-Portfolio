# Basic-Portfolio

I attempted to do this over the last couple of days, but with some help from the tutor and getting a better grasp on the things I wasn't clear on, I was able to do more with it. I also took a look and compared with other student's code, and how they had done things, pulled some things offline, and tried to do what I could. When I couldn't get any further with that, I played around with some of the effects and just tried to make it pretty. I wanted to make sure it was done before the next assignment, I think it was needed for it. I'm not too sure, I wasn't feeling really well at the end of the last class on Saturday.
