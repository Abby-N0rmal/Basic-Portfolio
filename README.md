# Basic-Portfolio

I attempted to do this over the last couple of days, but with some help from the tutor and getting a better grasp on the things I wasn't clear on, I was able to do more with it. I also took a look and compared with other students code, and how they had done things, as well as pulling some things off of google. 

I tried to do what I could. When I couldn't get any further with that, I played around with some of the effects and just tried to make it pretty. Most importantly, I learned a lot from the whole process, things I had no idea how to do before.
